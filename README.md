# GraphQL with Apollo Server and MongoDB

## Get started
Clone this repository, install dependencies and run start script. Make sure you're using yarn, and that you have a MongoDB instance running somewhere, then set your mongodb url inside `src/main.ts`.

Commands: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bruno-lombardi/graphql-mongodb
cd graphql-mongodb

As you make changes, the development server will restart automatically. By default, you can run the GraphQL Playground at http://localhost:4000.
